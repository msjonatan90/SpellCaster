Purpose:
The purpose of the library is to provide a simple and efficient way of parsing, validating, and evaluating SpEL expressions from JSON input.

Scope:
The library should include the following features:

A parser to convert a JSON string into a SpEL expression.
A validator to check if the JSON input is valid and meets the requirements of the SpEL expression.
An evaluator to evaluate the SpEL expression.
A set of predefined functions and operators that can be used in the SpEL expression.
The ability to define custom functions and operators.
The library should be written in Java.
The library should be easy to use and well-documented.
The library should have unit tests for all features.
Next, let's define the technical requirements for the library:

The library should use the Jackson library for JSON parsing and serialization.
The library should use the Spring Expression Language (SpEL) for evaluating expressions.
The library should have a modular design to allow for easy maintenance and expansion.
The library should be compatible with Java 8 and above.
The library should use Maven for dependency management.
The library should use JUnit for unit testing.
Finally, let's define the expected output of the library:

The library should be able to parse a valid JSON string into a SpEL expression.
The library should be able to validate the JSON input and return an error if the input is invalid.
The library should be able to evaluate the SpEL expression and return the result.
The library should be able to handle predefined functions and operators as well as custom functions and operators.
The library should have comprehensive documentation and examples to help users understand how to use it.
The library should have unit tests for all features and should pass all tests.
With these requirements, auto-gpt should be able to generate a first draft version of the library that meets the specified criteria.
