SpellCaster - The Lightweight JSON to SpEL Library
SpellCaster is an open-source library that enables the conversion of JSON expressions to Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expressions. It allows developers to use JSON expressions as a more lightweight and user-friendly alternative to writing SpEL expressions directly.

With SpellCaster, you can easily integrate complex expressions into your Spring-based application without sacrificing performance or readability. It's ideal for applications that require dynamic or user-generated expressions, such as data filtering, sorting, or transformation.
