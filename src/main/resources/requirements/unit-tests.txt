To ensure the correctness and reliability of your SpElCaster service, you should implement a comprehensive suite of unit tests. Here's a list of some of the most important unit tests to cover the key functionalities and requirements of the service:

Test parsing JSON context:

Test that valid JSON input is parsed correctly.
Test that invalid JSON input results in an appropriate error or exception.
Test storing JSON context in Redis:

Test that a given JSON context can be successfully stored in Redis with a specified key.
Test that an existing JSON context can be updated correctly.
Test retrieving JSON context from Redis:

Test that a stored JSON context can be retrieved by its key.
Test that retrieving a non-existent context results in an appropriate error or exception.
Test creating an EvaluationContext:

Test that an EvaluationContext is correctly created from a retrieved JSON context.
Test evaluating SpEL expressions:

Test that a valid SpEL expression is evaluated correctly against a given context.
Test that an invalid SpEL expression results in an appropriate error or exception.
Test evaluating expressions with various data types and structures (e.g., literals, variables, lists, maps, and nested objects).
Test evaluating expressions with various operators and functions (e.g., arithmetic, comparison, logical, and collection-based operations).
Test evaluating expressions with nested and compound expressions.
Test edge cases and error handling:

Test evaluating expressions against an empty or null context.
Test evaluating expressions with missing or invalid context properties.
Test evaluating expressions with large or complex JSON contexts.
Test handling timeouts and connection issues with Redis.
These unit tests will help ensure the correctness, robustness, and reliability of the SpElCaster service, covering key functionalities and requirements, as well as handling various edge cases and error conditions.
